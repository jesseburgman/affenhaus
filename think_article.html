			<p>The practice of color management evolved out of the need for consistant color across the universe of paper,printers, and inks within the print industry. The concept has since bled over to the web and mobile world, but is poorly understood at best by nearly all designers. The next two articles are a primer on why and how you should manage color in your web and UI design workflow.</p>
			<p><strong>Part one</strong> of this series is a quick overview of the terms and concepts needed to understand RGB color management.</p>
			<p><strong>Part two</strong> is a nuts and bolts tactical approach to setting up and integrating Adobe Creative Suite into a color managed work flow for desktop browsers and mobile devices.</p>
			<h3>RGB Defined</h3>
			<p>RGB is shorthand for red, green, blue which is how devices and monitors break down color at it’s most atomic level. RGB is a device-dependent color model: Since no two devices can physically reproduce color exactly the same way, a RGB value cannot define an absolute color.  Color management for RGB is designed to bring the ever expanding landscape of monitors and devices into as uniform representation of colors as possible. However, even with proper color management the sheer number of devices and viewing environments are too diffuse to hope for anything more than a near approximation of intended color.</p>
			<h3>Color Management Happens atThree Levels</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Operating System: (Ex: Setting your display profile in OSX settings)</li>
				<li>Application (Ex: Setting the workspace profile in Photoshop)</li>
				<li>File: (Ex: Embedded sRGB Profile in a JPEG)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>How those color spaces are applied and interpreted can have deep impacts on how color is finally rendered and perceived. OS manufactures, Photoshop, and browsers approach color management in different ways. To further complicate matters there is no requirement for applications or files to manage color at all. But navigating this complicated space is not as difficult as it appears.</p>
			<h3>Application of Color Profiles at Each Level</h3>
			<p><strong>Device Dependent Spaces:</strong> These are typically monitor profiles applied by the OS to address the specific response of the individual monitor. This profile is usually referenced as Monitor RGB. This is a baseline profile that is the monitor communicates to the computer via the connection cable. In most cases this profile can be calibrated to optimize its performance with respect to the surrounding environment.</p>
			<p><strong>Working Spaces:</strong> These are typically defined in your design environment (Ex: Photoshop). These profiles are designed explicitly to be suitable for image editing. They provide a wide gamut of colors for more true to life color. Popular choices are Adobe RGB and ProPhoto RGB. Since the profiles are applied at the application level, they usually impact only the application viewport.</p>
			<p><strong>Delivery Space:</strong> These profiles are designed accommodate the diverse viewing space of your audience. This profile type is applied at the file level and interpreted at the application level. The most common delivery space for web work is sRGB.</p>
			<p><strong>sRGB:</strong> This is the lowest common denominator. It’s anticipated that this space is within the hardware limitations of nearly all monitors and devices that display RGB. As such it’s considered the standard colorspace for the internet. It’s a narrow gamut space and therefore doesn’t have the number of colors or intensity of saturation provided by Adobe RGB. Because compressing wide gamut artwork to a narrow gamut color profile is a destructive and non-reversible action, it’s not advisable to edit in sRGB whenever possible.</p>
			<p><strong>Adobe RGB:</strong> This is an ideal working profile, and is commonly also used as an embedded space when delivering RGB files in non-web contexts. Most browsers, don’t recognize it however, so it’s not an acceptable space for web work.</p>
			<h3>Pulling it All Together</h3>
			<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of the tools available to manage color, where do we go from here? There are surprisingly few steps we can take to manage color.  Adjusting our local device dependent space so we’re viewing the most accurate color possible is the first step. Since we have no control over the end users viewing environment, the only other place we can contribute to color consistency is in the image editing environment.</p>
			<p>In a perfect world any application could show multiple images in the same viewport, and each image would have a color profile that best suits it’s individual need in concert with the monitor profile to provide the best color for that specific viewing environment. With web browsers we’re not there yet. To mitigate this we have take different approaches for photography and rasterized UI elements.</p>
